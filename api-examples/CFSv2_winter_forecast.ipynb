    "# Using a CFSv2 forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "__[CFSv2](https://data.planetos.com/datasets/ncep_cfsv2)__  is a seasonal forecast system, used for analysing past climate and also making seasonal, up to 9-month, forecasts. Here we give a brief example on how to use Planet OS API to merge 9-month forecasts started at different initial times, into a single ensemble forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble forecasting is a traditional technique in medium range (up to 10 days) weather forecasts, seasonal forecasts and climate modelling. By changing initial conditions or model parameters, a range of forecasts is created, which differ from each other slightly, due to the chaotic nature of fluid dynamics (which weather modelling is a subset of). For weather forecasting, the ensemble is usually created by small changes in initial conditions, but for seasonal forecast, it is much easier to just take real initial conditions every 6-hours. Here we are going to show, first how to merge the different dates into a single plot with the help of python pandas library, and in addition we show that even 6-hour changes in initial conditions can lead to large variability in long range forecasts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we look into 2 m temperture for upcoming winter. We are also adding climatological averages from __[CFS Reanalysis Climatologies](https://data.planetos.com/datasets/ncep_cfsr_climatologies)__ to the plot for better overview. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have more interest in Planet OS API, please refer to our official __[documentation](data.planetos.com/datasets)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also note that the `API_client` python routine, used in this notebook, is still experimental and will change in the future, so take it just as a guidance using the API, and not as an official tool."
